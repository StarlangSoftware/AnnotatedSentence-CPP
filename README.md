# AnnotatedSentence

This resource allows for matching of Turkish words or expressions with their corresponding entries within the Turkish dictionary and the Turkish PropBank, morphological analysis, named entity recognition and shallow parsing.

For Developers
============
You can also see either [Python](https://github.com/olcaytaner/AnnotatedSentence-Py) 
or [Java](https://github.com/olcaytaner/AnnotatedSentence) repository.
## Requirements

* [C++ Compiler](#cpp)
* [Git](#git)


### CPP
To check if you have compatible C++ Compiler installed,
* Open CLion IDE 
* Preferences >Build,Execution,Deployment > Toolchain  

### Git

Install the [latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Download Code

In order to work on code, create a fork from GitHub page. 
Use Git for cloning the code to your local or below line for Ubuntu:

	git clone <your-fork-git-link>

A directory called AnnotatedSentence-CPP will be created. Or you can use below link for exploring the code:

	git clone https://github.com/olcaytaner/AnnotatedSentence-CPP.git

## Open project with CLion IDE

To import projects from Git with version control:

* Open CLion IDE , select Get From Version Control.

* In the Import window, click URL tab and paste github URL.

* Click open as Project.

Result: The imported project is listed in the Project Explorer view and files are loaded.


## Compile

**From IDE**

After being done with the downloading and opening project, select **Build Project** option from **Build** menu. After compilation process, user can run TestAnnotatedSen.cpp .

## Data Format

The structure of a sample annotated word is as follows:

	{turkish=yatırımcılar}
	{analysis=yatırımcı+NOUN+A3PL+PNON+NOM}
	{semantics=0841060}
	{namedEntity=NONE}
	{shallowParse=ÖZNE}
	{propbank=ARG0:0006410}

As is self-explanatory, 'turkish' tag shows the original Turkish word; 'analysis' tag shows the correct morphological parse of that word; 'semantics' tag shows the ID of the correct sense of that word; 'namedEntity' tag shows the named entity tag of that word; 'shallowParse' tag shows the semantic role of that word; 'propbank' tag shows the semantic role of that word for the verb synset id (frame id in the frame file) which is also given in that tag.
